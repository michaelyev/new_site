    "heroP": "Have a plot of land that you want to utilize to its full potential? Building an ADU or DADU can be a great benefit to your property. Not only does it increase the value of your home, but it also offers you options for potential earnings. RENOVA Contractors can assist you in building an accessory dwelling unit or a detached dwelling unit, handling everything from the initial cost estimate to architectural and structural engineering plans that are done by an in-house licensed architect. We guarantee an expedited process with all permits needed to complete and start the construction of your ADU.\n\nThe project length that we typically run into for building custom detached accessory dwelling units can range from 3 months up to five months. All permits, architectural drawings, and structural plans are completed within two months. For attached dwelling units, itâ€™s a bit more streamlined flow. From your first call and one-on-one consultation with our estimator and architect, you will be presented with a detailed cost sheet for the construction of your future ADU or DADU. While we are attaining all the necessary permits, you will be closely working with our architect and interior designer to source all your finishing materials to ensure a timely start of your project when all documentation requirements of your local municipality have been met.\n\nRENOVA Contractors guarantee a dedicated project manager that will be available to you through the whole duration of the construction project. For such scale, we make sure that our client is informed and updated through every step of the project. Our firm employs only licensed plumbers and electricians, along with an architect and structural engineer, to ensure a smooth process and completion of the ADU or DADU.\n\nWe have been building accessory dwelling units in the state of Washington for half a decade, with a proven track record of success and quality. Our past clients can be contacted as a point of reference. We provide this as an extra resource for our future clients, where you can communicate with our previous customers to find out in detail how we operate."
