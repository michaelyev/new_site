At Renova Contractors, we make our clients the top priority throughout the entire kitchen remodeling process. Every kitchen is unique, and we ensure our clients get exactly what they want by conducting a detailed consultation to determine the desired style and functionality. A kitchen is a vital component of any home and contributes significantly to overall resale value.\n\nKitchen remodels typically take between three to eight weeks, depending on the size of the kitchen and the quality of materials selected for countertops and cabinets. After the initial kitchen remodel consultation, we provide a detailed cost sheet—not just an estimate—because we believe in transparency for both major and minor remodels.\n\nEvery homeowner should understand that a kitchen remodel involves precise measurements for cabinets, along with electrical and plumbing work, to ensure everything not only looks great but is also safe and reliable.\n\nOne important factor to keep in mind is that permits may be required, particularly for plumbing, electrical, or gas line work.\n\nThe key decisions homeowners need to make when preparing for a kitchen remodel include the style and color of cabinets, the choice of countertops, and the design of the backsplash.\n\nRenova Contractors handles the rest—from permitting and design to installation and the full realization of your dream kitchen.",

Renova Contractors are pros at transforming your unused basement space into a finished basement with proper insulation, where you can spend time comfortably all year round.\n\nUnlike other parts of the home, a basement remodel is one of the simplest projects, yet it involves several vital steps to ensure a comfortable atmosphere. A successful basement remodeling project includes interior waterproofing, basement foundation insulation on the inside, and electrical work.\n\nTo give your basement a great finished look, you don’t need much—just drywall, a good paint selection, and the right lighting to ensure an adequate amount of brightness that prevents your basement from feeling cold and dark.\n\nAn important component is flooring. Don’t just lay down carpet or luxury vinyl planks in your basement—make sure your contractor installs an underlayment. A remodeled basement might be cold and collect moisture underneath the planks if this step is overlooked.\n\nRenova Contractors ensures not only a great look for your remodeled basement, but we also prioritize durability and comfort. All this can be achieved with a contractor who knows what to do when remodeling a basement.\n\nDuring our basement renovation consultation, we’ll go over the important technical aspects, and you’ll tell us about your interior design preferences."

      "heroP": "Basement foundations are the most critical part of any home that has a foundation. With a leaky basement foundation, you will run into major problems down the road. A poor basement waterproofing job can not only cost you thousands of dollars in damages, but it also carries significant health risks.\n\nMany old and newly built homes have improper basement waterproofing systems installed, where the builder or contractor cut corners. Now, your foundation becomes a magnet for moisture and water, which will eventually get into your basement—where mold will grow and moisture will accumulate in the air.\n\nRenova Contractors has completed over a hundred basement waterproofing projects, ensuring that your foundation stays dry. It is important to follow local requirements for such projects, as they often involve heavy machinery, plumbing work, and sometimes electrical work, since the perimeter of your home must be cleared of any obstructions.\n\nA properly waterproofed basement foundation includes several layered components installed on a dry foundation. With the warranty we provide, our clients feel an extra layer of safety and confidence in their basement foundation."

Not only does it increase the value of your home, but it also offers you options for potential earnings.

We guarantee an expedited process with all permits needed to complete and start the construction of your ADU.\n\nThe project length that we typically run into for building custom detached accessory dwelling units can range from 3 months up to five months.

For such scale, we make sure that our client is informed and updated through every step of the project. Our firm employs only licensed plumbers and electricians, along with an architect and structural engineer, to ensure a smooth process and completion of the ADU or DADU.\n\nWe have been building accessory dwelling units in the state of Washington for half a decade, with a proven track record of success and quality.
